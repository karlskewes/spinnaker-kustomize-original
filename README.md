# Spinnaker Kustomize

Kustomize based installation for Spinnaker.

Repository goals:

1. Optimize for deployment of a basic Spinnaker installation with one command.
1. No Halyard, kleat or other tools for configuration. Use the services default
   configuration (eg: `clouddriver.yml`) and leverage Spring Profile's for
   customization (eg: `clouddriver-local.yml`).
1. Minimize duplication and maintainence. Only minimal configuration and
   patterns are defined in this repository. See
   [spinnaker.io](https://spinnaker.io) Docs and service source code for all
   available options.

Please fork this repository and develop any customizations locally.

Please contribute documentation updates to https://github.com/spinnaker/spinnaker.io

## Prerequisites

Before you start, you will need:

- A Kubernetes cluster and `kubectl` configured to communicate with that
  cluster or for testing you can use the provided example `kind` cluster.

## Quick start

If required, start a local [https://kind.sigs.k8s.io/](KinD) cluster:

```
make create

# kind create cluster --name spinnaker --config kind.yml
```

Generate Kubernetes yaml:

```
make build

# kubectl kustomize -o ./spinnaker.yaml
```

Check what Kubernetes cluster are pointing to:

```
kubectl config current-context
```

Install Spinnaker into the cluster:

```
make apply

# kubectl apply -f ./spinnaker.yaml
```

## Customizing Spinnaker

Production workloads require higher reliability and scale than the default
configuration will support. See [spinnaker.io](https://spinnaker.io) for
configuration options.

1. Fork this repository
1. (Optional) modify `./kustomization.yml`
1. (Optional) add configuration to `./overlays/config/files/`
1. (Optional) add components and overlays

## Configuration

During application startup default configuration is loaded from
`/opt/<service>/config/<service>.yml`

Custom configuration is loaded from: `/opt/spinnaker/config/`.

You can add your config to: `./overlays/config/files/clouddriver-local.yml`.

This file is added to the `clouddriver` ConfigMap and mounted into the
container at `/opt/spinnaker/config/clouddriver-local.yml`.

The Java services leverage Spring Boot framework so some configuration is
defined via Spring Boot [common application properties](https://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/docs/2.4.13/reference/html/appendix-application-properties.html#common-application-properties).

Configuration sources merge per Spring Boot [external configuration](https://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/docs/2.4.13/reference/html/spring-boot-features.html#boot-features-external-config).

Note both of the above Spring Boot links are subject to change as Spinnaker
upgrades Spring Boot versions. See: [Spinnaker Dependency
Versions](https://github.com/spinnaker/kork/blob/master/spinnaker-dependencies/spinnaker-dependencies.gradle)

## Secrets

This Kustomize installer is unopinonated about secrets, see:
[Spinnaker Secret Engines](https://spinnaker.io/docs/reference/halyard/secrets/#non-halyard-configuration).

## Working with Kustomize

See the [official Kustomize documentation](https://kubectl.docs.kubernetes.io/references/kustomize/).

### Kustomize Components

The Java services leverage [Spring Application Properties - Wildcard Locations](https://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/docs/current/reference/html/features.html#features.external-config.files.wildcard-locations).
This means that custom `components` or `overlays` can also mount files at
`/opt/spinnaker/config/<example>/<service>.yml`.

Where `<service>.yml` can be `{application}.yml` or `{application}-{profile}.yml`.

For example, adding MariaDB support to Clouddriver:

1. In the `./components/mariadb/` directory
1. `files/clouddriver.yml` contains Clouddriver SQL configuration
1. `kustomization.yml` generates a ConfigMap `clouddriver-mariadb` with the
   above file
1. The ConfigMap is added to the Clouddriver Deployment Projected Volume
   sources, mounting the file at: `/opt/spinnaker/config/mariadb/clouddriver.yml`

The quick start MariaDB and Redis components spawn a ConfigMap per component.
This convention enables the components to be standalone in this repository.

Something similar could be done when multiple Spinnaker installations are
being managed with Kustomize. Create a component/overlay called `dev` and
another for `prod` and put environment specific files there. Mount these at
`/opt/spinnaker/config/<dev|prod>/clouddriver.yml`. Note Spring's merge
behavior linked further up.

Separating configuration across many files and ConfigMap's can make development
and troubleshooting difficult so try to put configuration directly into a
single file such as `clouddriver-local.yml`.

If this is insufficient then consider adapting the MariaDB component pattern
and sharing a ConfigMap via [configMapGenerator](https://kubectl.docs.kubernetes.io/references/kustomize/kustomization/configmapgenerator/)
`create` and `merge` options.

### Kustomize limitations

Additional files can be added (merged) into a `ConfigMap`. However, it is not
possible to append lines to a Kubernetes `ConfigMap` item, for example:

```
  data:
    clouddriver-local.yml: |
      # Some existing configuration

      # << Kustomize can't merge or append lines to clouddriver-local.yml
```

Many Spinnaker installations use custom Spring Profile's to load additional
configuration.

Unfortunately Kustomize `ValueAddTransformer` has limited functionality and
it is not possible to append strings. For example, appending custom Spring
Profiles to each container's `SPRING_PROFILES_ACTIVE` environment variable.

It is possible to replace strings so that could be suitable for some use cases.
